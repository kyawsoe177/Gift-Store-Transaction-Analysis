# Key Insights

- The UK generates the highest total revenue by a significant margin, contributing the largest share to the overall revenue.
- Countries outside of the UK, including several in Europe and notably Australia, also contribute to revenue.
- A noticeable portion (approximately 25%) of total revenue is reduced due to returns or discounts.
- Certain customers have disproportionately high numbers of returns or negative transactions.

# Actionable Recommendations

- UK-based strategies should be strengthened (e.g., loyalty programs, targeted promotions) since it is the top revenue source.
- Given sales presence in countries outside the UK, targeted international marketing or local partnerships could yield growth.
- A 25% reduction from returns and discounts suggests the need to review return policies or improve product quality.
- Regular tracking of country-wise and customer-wise performance will help proactively address revenue leakage from returns and discounts.
